### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a robotics researcher working on new trajectory representations to enable motion recognition and robot task learning with sparse data.

I am interested in numerical optimization, optimal control, 3D kinematics, differential geometry, robot control, machine learning and state estimation.
